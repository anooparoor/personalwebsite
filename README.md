I joined Amazon robotics in 2019 after completing my PhD in computer science from [CUNY](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/). My PhD work was mainly in the areas in robot navigation amound crowds and human-robot interactions and resulted in [several papers.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qTDb7kAAAAAJ&hl=en)

Since 2019, I worked on scaling and improving path planning for [~750,000 robots](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/how-amazon-deploys-robots-in-its-operations-facilities) at Amazon that helps customers get faster and cheaper deliveries. This included both fenced-off [kiva system based robots](https://spectrum.ieee.org/three-engineers-hundreds-of-robots-one-warehouse) and newer [autonomous robots](https://spectrum.ieee.org/amazon-warehouse-robots) that need to navigate in crowded environments.
